# Reaction-Test-Tool

This APP can help test your responsiveness. Through the test, you can understand your reaction and make a plan to improve your reaction ability accordingly.
This is a simple tool to measure your reaction time.
The reaction time of non-trained athletes is usually between 0.2 and 0.3 seconds, while a well-trained athlete can only reach 0.1 to 0.2 seconds.

In addition to measuring your reaction time, this test is affected by the latency of your phone. Using a fast phone and low latency / high framerate monitor will improve your score.

This is discused in further detail on the the statistics page. While an average human reaction time may fall between 200-250ms, your phone could be adding 10-50ms on top. 

If you want, you can keep track of your scores, and see your full history of reaction times.

Just perform at least 5 clicks and then save.

So, keep training, and you'll be more responsive.
